## Prompt Overview

The prompt is designed to provide you with quick and useful information at a glance:

- **Current Directory**: Displayed at the start of the prompt, showing the name of your current directory.

- **Git Information**: Displayed after the current directory, indicating the Git repository status. It includes the Git branch name, and whether there are uncommitted changes or not.

- **Time Since Last Commit**: Displayed at the end of the prompt, showing the time elapsed since the last Git commit. If you're not in a Git repository, a "‚ú≠" character is displayed.

- **Exit Status Indicator**: In the right prompt (RPROMPT), it shows a green checkmark (‚úî) for a successful command execution and a red "X" (‚úò) for a failed command execution.

## Indicators and Their Meanings

### Current Directory Indicator

- **Folder Icon (üìÅ)**: The folder icon emoji indicates your current directory.

### Git Information Indicators

- **Git Branch Indicator (üëæ)**: The "üëæ" emoji indicates that you are in a Git repository.

- **Git Clean Indicator (‚úî)**: A green checkmark (‚úî) indicates that the Git repository has no uncommitted changes. Your working directory is clean.

- **Git Dirty Indicator (‚úò)**: A red "X" (‚úò) indicates that the Git repository has uncommitted changes. Your working directory is dirty.

### Time Since Last Commit Indicator

- The "ago" text after the time duration indicates how long ago the last Git commit was made.

- If the last commit was made within the last 30 minutes, the time is displayed in green, indicating recent activity.

- If the last commit was made within the last 4 hours, the time is displayed in yellow, indicating somewhat recent activity.

- If the last commit was made more than 4 hours ago, the time is displayed in red, indicating that it's been a while since the last commit
